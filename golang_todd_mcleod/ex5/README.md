* print out the value of the variable “x”
* print out the type of the variable “x”
* assign your own VALUE to the VARIABLE “x” using the “=” OPERATOR
* print out the value of the variable “x”       
3. now do this
1. now use CONVERSION to convert the TYPE of the VALUE stored in “x” to the UNDERLYING TYPE
